## (1) Kuhn & Johnson 7.2

>  Friedman (1991) introduced several benchmark data sets create by simulation. One of these simulations used the following nonlinear equation to create data: $y = 10\text{sin}(\pi x_1 x_2)+20(x_3-0.5)^2+10x_4+5x_5+N(0,\sigma^2)$; where the $x$ values are random variables uniformly distributed between $[0, 1]$ (there are also 5 other non-informative variables also created in the simulation). 

**The package `mlbench` contains a function called `mlbench.friedman1` that simulates these data:** 

```{r kj-7.2-ex1, echo=T}

sim_seed <- 1234

set.seed(sim_seed) 

## Create a list with a vector y and a matrix of predictors x
sim_train <- mlbench.friedman1(200, sd = 1)
sim_train$x <- data.frame(sim_train$x)

# Create a test set against which to predict
sim_test <- mlbench.friedman1(5000, sd = 1)
sim_test$x <- data.frame(sim_test$x)

# Review the data distribution 
featurePlot(sim_train$x, sim_train$y)

```


>> (a) Tune several models on these data. For example: 

Model 1 (example): KNN model

```{r kj-7.2-ex2, eval=F, echo=T}

# Tuned KNN model fit
sim_fit_knn

# Plot of optimal KNN fit by k minimizing RMSE
sim_plot_knn

```

We begin with a K Nearest Neighbors model.  Before fitting the model we preprocess the predictors, scaling and centering them.  To identify the optimal number of neighbors (k / mtry) for the model, we perform a grid search and evaluate RMSE for each grouping.  RMSE is lowest for a model with 8 neighbors, so we select that model.

<br>

Model 2: Neural Network

```{r kj-7.2-1, echo=T, eval=F}

# TURNED OFF THIS CHUNK FOR JO SO DOC COULD KNIT

# Neural network implementation using model averaging and limiting features to those that see pairwise correlation < .75 %>% 
sim_train$x %>% 
  cor() %>%  # calculate correlation matrix
  round(digits = 2) %>%  # round r to two digits
  ggcorrplot(hc.order = TRUE,
             type = "upper",
             outline.color = "white")
    
# Tuned NN model fit
sim_fit_avgnnet

# Plot of optimal NN fit minimizing RMSE
sim_plot_avgnnet

```

Next we build a neural network model employing an averaging approach.  Pairwise correlatiion between predictors has a very negative impact on NN models, so we begin by examining that - as correlation is minimal, there is no need to pre-filter the predictors.  After scaling and centering predictors, we fit the model.  A grid search of hyper-parameters reveals that weight decay (lambda) of .1 and 3 hidden units yields the lowest RMSE, so we select that model.

<br>

Model 3: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines
```{r kj-7.2-2}

# Tuned MARS model fit
sim_fit_mars$bestTune
sim_fit_mars$finalModel

# Plot of optimal MARS fit minimizing RMSE
sim_plot_mars

```

We continue by assembling a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines model.  MARS prunes features - and terms combining features - that do no contribute to predictive accuracy of the model based on the GCV statistic.  We perform a grid search on two hyper-parameters: degree, which allows for interactions between two features in terms; and nprune, which constrains the number of terms to retain between 2 and 38.  The MARS model minimizes RMSE when selecting 14 of 20 terms using the first five of 10 predictors (X4, X1, X2, X5, and X3).  We select this as our best model.

<br>

Model 4: Support Vector Machines
```{r kj-7.2-3}

sim_fit_svm$finalModel
sim_fit_svm

# Plot of optimal NN fit minimizing RMSE
sim_plot_svm

```

Lastly, we build a Support Vectors Regression model using a radial basis function kernel.  We standardize (center / scale) predictors before modeling; cross-validation over 10 folds, we find best RMSE performance when cost (C) is 16 and sigma is .0734, for a hyperplane margin that is neither on the large nor small side.

<br>

>> (b) Which models appear to give the best performance? Does MARS select the informative predictors (those named X1-X5)?

```{r kj-7.2-4}

# Compare model performance on RMSE
sim_model_compare

# Confirm which predictors the MARS model prunes
sim_fit_mars$finalModel

```

MARS delivers the best performance, with an RMSE of 1.19.  The MARs model does select the most informative five predictors - phew!

<br>

## (2) Kuhn & Johnson 7.5

>  Exercise 6.3 describes data for a chemical manufacturing process. Use the same data imputation, data splitting, and pre-processing steps as before and train several nonlinear regression models.

Using the same data, imputation, splits, pre-proceesing, and seed, we train three models: and SVM model with radial basis function kernel, a KNN model, and a MARS model.

<br>

>> (a) Which nonlinear regression model gives the optimal resampling and test set performance? 

```{r kj-7.5a}

chem_perf_table

```

Compared with the SVM and MARS models, the KNN model with five neighbors affords the best performance in terms of both RMSE and MAE.

<br>

>> (b) Which predictors are most important in the optimal nonlinear regression model? Do either the biological or process variables dominate the list? How do the top ten important predictors compare to the top ten predictors from the optimal linear model? 

```{r kj-7.5b}

chem_varimp_knn_plot

```

Ranked by magnitude, the first nineteen predictors are greater than zero; thereafter, predictors' importance is approximately zero.  The most important predictors are Biological Material 06, Manufacturing Process 09, Biological Material 12, and Biological Material 03.  Of the nineteen predictors with non-zero importance, eleven are Manufacturing and eight are Biological.  Given there is nearly a four-to-one ratio between Manufacturing and Biological predictors overall, Biological are comparatively over-represented.

<br>

>> (c) Explore the relationships between the top predictors and the response for the predictors that are unique to the optimal nonlinear regression model. Do these plots reveal intuition about the biological or process predictors and their relationship with yield?

```{r kj-7.5c}

# High variable importance predictors
chem_corr_toppred('BiologicalMaterial06')
chem_corr_toppred('ManufacturingProcess09')
chem_corr_toppred('BiologicalMaterial12')
chem_corr_toppred('BiologicalMaterial03')

# Low variable importance predictors
chem_corr_toppred('ManufacturingProcess09')
chem_corr_toppred('BiologicalMaterial05')

```

To understand the general contour of the relationship between each of the important predictors and the response we plot them against one another, including a Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) line to help depict the general tendency.  

All four predictors have a positive slope.  When compared with a few predictors with low variable importance, the slope appears steeper, which accords with our intuition of a stronger relationship.

Per the fitted KNN regression model, Biological Material 06 has the largest variable importance and Manufacturing Process 09 has the second largest.  When comparing LOESS curves the Manufacturing Process 09 appears to have the steepest slope, however that may be impacted by a number of leverage points on the left end of the range.
