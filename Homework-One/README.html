<h1>Homework Process</h1>

<p>This is the folder for the first of our two group homework assignments</p>
<p>I have created a folder for each week with homework assigned. You should drop your homework into the appropriate weeks folder</p>

    
<h2> File Formats</h2>
    
<p>Either .r or .Rmd is fine, so long as you include any data not included in the packages with it so we can all reproduce the problems in building the final submission</p>
    
<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
    
<p>if you name your homework for each week by your 'first name-week', then we can track who's doing what and ask the right people for help/clarification or to use pieces and parts</p>
    
<strong> Example:</strong>
    
    <p> bethany-one.Rmd</p>
    <p> bethany-one.R</p>
<h2>Submission File</h2>
As we agreed in our first group meeting, the submission for each of the homeworks (and possibly group projects depending ont he scope) will be an <em>r bookdown</em> document in PDF format which Professor Burke can access from anywhere!
